# Weather Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a weather prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data like weather patterns.

## Overview

This project uses LSTMs to predict future weather conditions based on historical weather data. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them effective for capturing trends and patterns in weather data. The model is trained on historical weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and can then be used to predict future weather conditions.

## Features

* **LSTM Network:** Implements a weather prediction model using LSTM layers.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, scaling, handling missing values) to prepare the weather data for the LSTM network.
* **Feature Engineering:** *(If implemented)* May include feature engineering techniques to create new features from existing ones (e.g., adding time-based features).
* **Training and Evaluation:** Provides scripts for training the LSTM model and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
* **Visualization:** *(If implemented)* Includes visualizations of the predicted weather conditions compared to the actual conditions.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **TensorFlow or Keras:** The deep learning framework used.
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow  # Or pip install keras if using Keras directly
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
Pandas: For data manipulation and reading weather data.
Bash
